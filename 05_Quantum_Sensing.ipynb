    "### 🧪 Physical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the 1600s, Newton believed that everything was made of particles.  \n",
    "- The double-slit experiment later showed that particles like electrons exhibit both wave and particle behaviors—these are **quantum objects**.  \n",
    "- Everything we know behaves fundamentally like a wave that can also exhibit particle-like properties.  \n",
    "- Quantum Mechanics is a **non-relativistic** theory.  \n",
    "- A photon is actually an excitation of the **electromagnetic field**, which becomes visible when interacting with our eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Fundamental Properties of Quantum Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement is made.  \n",
    "- **Entanglement**: Two or more particles can be correlated so that the state of one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance.  \n",
    "- **Interference**: Quantum probability amplitudes can add constructively or destructively, changing the likelihood of outcomes.  \n",
    "- **Measurement Collapse**: Measuring a quantum system forces it into one of its basis states, destroying the superposition.  \n",
    "- **No-Cloning Theorem**: You cannot create an exact copy of an unknown quantum state.  \n",
    "- **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers that would be impossible to cross in classical physics.  \n",
    "- **Unitary Evolution**: A closed quantum system evolves over time via reversible unitary operations, governed by the Schrödinger equation.  \n",
    "- **Quantum Decoherence**: Interaction with the environment causes loss of quantum behavior, effectively making the system classical.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Double-Slit Experiment (Wave–Particle Duality)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrates fundamental quantum properties like **interference** and **duality**.  \n",
    "- When we do **not observe** which slit a particle goes through, we see an interference pattern—evidence of wave-like behavior.  \n",
    "- When we **observe** the slits, the interference pattern disappears, and we only see single-slit behavior—this is due to **decoherence**.  \n",
    "- Measuring the particle’s path collapses the wavefunction, causing the system to act classically.  \n",
    "- To observe the particle, we emit photons (or another probe) which interacts with it—this interaction leads to **decoherence**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Quantum Measurement & Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Hamiltonian operator** gives the **expected value** (average outcome) of a measurement, not the actual result of a single shot.  \n",
    "- Measurements in quantum circuits are based on **observables**, defined by Hermitian operators.  \n",
    "- We aim to become not just **Quantum Computer Scientists** who understand some physics, but **Quantum Engineers**—experts in using quantum hardware and software under the quantum paradigm.\n",

    "- Quantum states are measured in **high and low energy levels**, analogous to 0 and 1 (as in transistor logic).  \n",

    "- Superconducting qubits operate using **fermionic electrons** and **bosonic photons**.  \n",
    "- Electrons, being fermions, obey the **Pauli exclusion principle**—no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state.  \n",
    "- However, when cooled near absolute zero, electrons can form **Cooper pairs** (bosonic behavior), enabling them to occupy the same energy level.  \n",

    "- In **transmon qubits**, energy levels like |G₀⟩, |G₁⟩, |G₂⟩ form an **anharmonic oscillator**.  \n",
